# ML Data Analysis Suite

An interactive desktop application for exploratory data analysis and machine learning on tabular datasets.

The tool allows users to load CSV or Excel files, visualize relationships between variables, train a linear regression model, and export results to PDF or Excel — all through a simple graphical interface.

## Features
- Load CSV and Excel datasets
- Automatic data description and summary statistics
- Data visualization using pair plots
- Feature and target selection via UI
- Linear regression model training
- Model evaluation (MSE, MAE)
- Export results to PDF and Excel

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- PyQt5
- FPDF

## Typical Workflow
1. Load a dataset (CSV / Excel)
2. Explore summary statistics
3. Visualize feature relationships
4. Select features and target variable
5. Train a regression model
6. Export results and metrics

## Use Case
This project is intended for data exploration, experimentation, and educational purposes. It is designed to help analysts and non-technical users interact with machine learning workflows without writing code.

## Disclaimer
This application is for learning and analysis purposes only and is not intended for production or decision-critical use.
